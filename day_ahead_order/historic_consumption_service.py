        Gets the historic consumption of a connection using a market & measurement platform.

            connection:
            time_start: (assumed by Art큰rs) beginning of first hour
                to look for historic consumption (inclusive)

                Both time_start and time_end are expected to be timezone-aware
                and express moments in the same time zone.
